This book is based on my 3+ years of experience with building, deploying, and operating [Jaeger](https://www.jaegertracing.io), an open-source distributed tracing platform at [Uber Technologies, Inc.](https://eng.uber.com/distributed-tracing/), and my involvement with the standardization efforts, such as the [CNCF OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io) project and the [W3C Distributed Tracing Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/distributed-tracing/). It is a practical guide to distributed tracing, offering end-to-end (get it?) coverage of the field.

_I started reading this book as I felt unsatisfied with the free resources found online and it proved to be a very wise decision. The book is easy to follow, very informative and well structured. It provides the insights/tools/questions you should ask when deciding to implement distributed tracing._

_This is hands down the best book on distributing tracing for modern cloud native applications._
