**Publisher**: Nova Science Publishers, Inc. (December 21, 2007)

I co-authored one of the chapters of this book: Chapter 1 - Simulated Evolution of Cerebral Hemisphere Asymmetries and Emergent Lateralization, pp. 1-38, by Alexander Grushin, Yuri Shkuro, James A. Reggia.

Amusing fact: I keep seeing it selling for over $200 on [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/1600219314/).
